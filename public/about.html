<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Debashrit Dwibedi, a dedicated Senior Engineer - Planning with over nine years of experience
   driving successful construction projects across India. My career is rooted in delivering precise project schedules 
   and innovative solutions. Passionate about transforming complex challenges into streamlined processes, I thrive on collaborating with
    stakeholders to ensure projects are completed on time, within budget, and to the highest standards. My commitment 
    to excellence and continuous learning has shaped my journey in the construction industry, where I aim to create 
    lasting impact through strategic planning and execution.</p>

<p>My technical expertise centers on Oracle Primavera P6 PPM and EPPM, complemented by hands in AutoCAD,
   Revit, and MS Project. I have developed and managed L1-L4 schedules, optimized resources, and achieved 
   significant cost savings, upto 8% reduction through meticulous planning. Beyond 
   scheduling, I bring a creative edge to projects by curating premium design portfolios, including modular
    kitchen and house elevation layouts, to enhance client visualizations. My ability to integrate cutting-edge 
    tools, like AI-driven analytics, with traditional planning methodologies ensures efficient workflows 
    and data-driven decisions, making me a versatile asset to any project team.</p>
